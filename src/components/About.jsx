            Hello! I'm Arbie, my journey into web development started with a
            curiosity for how websites are built and has grown into a
            full-fledged passion for coding and problem-solving. I'm always
            eager to learn new skills and take on new challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I'm off on adventures! I love traveling to new
            places and blending in with the locals. I'm also a big fan of trying
            out new hobbies and diving headfirst into them. Right now, I'm all
            about rock climbing/bouldering.
